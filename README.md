"A Bridge To Anywhere"

(CCIP Protocol for IERC677) 

 


Yes we are using existing Protocols but to make a distinction it's like building a car yes there are other cars but none are 100% autonomous. Which is similarly what we we are looking to create. 

In my opinion 100% autonomy is hard to achieve because there is no infrastructure for something like that to exist in a safe manner there will always be a liability of harm and one hair on a child's head is to risky. But if you had an autonomous highway where the autonomy could be activated leaving the liability on an insured licensed vehicle owner for operating autonomously in a no autonomy zone.. then yes that would speed the process along. Tell Elon I said that one is on me. Lol. 

In that scenario yes building an autonomous infrastructure would be costly and probably exceed risk vs reward,  but in our decentralized world building the infrastructure, to be more specific a CCIP "Bridge to Anywhere" is definitely in reach especially with chainlink leading the way with its current technology. 

StrangeDollar Company is currently researching ways to build an IERC677 that can access all All DeFi Protocols exchanges and platforms via smart contracts and chainlink oracles. However there is no infrastructure that would allow deployment of this type (muti-chain deployment, value transfer and external real world data) or magnitude without incurring massive cost and deployment errors. And the current options are limited. 

example: A contract may  have aave Protocols or uniswap Protocols or both or even similar to BiFi protocol using Ethereum  and Binance but they are still limited in arbitrage  opportunities as well as staking, yield farming and swaping opportunities etc. By creating an IERC677 that can be deployed on any blockchain or multiple chains with all defi protocols and  access to all exchanges in theory  increases the arbitrage opportunities, Defi options and decreases operational cost.  With a CCIP type infrastructure as we like to call it "A Bridge to Anywhere" is what we are looking to build or assist building  to  point our IERC677  in that direction via smart contract. Just the idea alone should give engineers and developers food for thought.

In short it is not necessarily the IERC677 which in theory is something I haven't seen built with the same intent and purpose that would be the the new development but its path would be revolutionary for Defi as a community creat a completly different approach to coin/token creation moving the decentralized community away from speculation as a strategy and towards "Cryptographic Truth" Also it would beg those industries that have not made an attempt at Defi or just the decentralized space to give it a shot. 

Example: Transactional funding for double closings in a wholesale real estate deal. Creating a real estate blockchain to later create opportunities for funding conventional Real Estate deals. 

MANEUVERABILITY (I think that's a word) or interoperability cross chain could definitely be the point where Centralized and Decentralized say hey we need each other.

The Dames Point - Repository #6

Is what we would like to build first.

All project repositories are currently only accessible by collaborators. 

Thanks,
